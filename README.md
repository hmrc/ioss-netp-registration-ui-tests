# ioss-netp-registration-ui-tests

IOSS NETP Registration UI journey tests.

## Pre-requisites

### Services

Start Mongo Docker container as follows:

```bash
docker run --rm -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongo percona/percona-server-mongodb:6.0
```

Start IMPORT_ONE_STOP_SHOP_ALL services as follows:

```bash
sm2 --start IMPORT_ONE_STOP_SHOP_ALL
```

## Tests

Run tests on the command line via one of the run scripts:
```bash
./run_tests.sh
```
or
```bash
./run_extra_tests.sh
```

These were simply split into two scripts so that they could run in parallel on Jenkins to save time.

Note: we have also created run scripts for the QA environment - run_tests_qa.sh and run_extra_tests_qa.sh, however they
will only work when all of the connected services are stubbed out and are only required for very specific uses, such
as testing audit events when all downstream services and pre-requisite third party data setup is not available.

## Scalafmt

Check all project files are formatted as expected as follows:

```bash
sbt scalafmtCheckAll scalafmtCheck
```

Format `*.sbt` and `project/*.scala` files as follows:

```bash
sbt scalafmtSbt
```

Format all project files as follows:

```bash
sbt scalafmtAll
```
